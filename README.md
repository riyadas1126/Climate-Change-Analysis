**Climate Change Analysis – CO₂ Concentrations and Temperature Anomalies**
**Project Overview**
This project analyzes the relationship between CO₂ concentrations and global temperature anomalies using historical data. It explores trends, correlations, and seasonal patterns to understand the impact of emissions on climate change. The project also predicts future temperature changes under different emission scenarios.
**Key Features**
**Trend Analysis:**
Examines historical trends in CO₂ levels and temperature anomalies.
**Correlation Analysis:**
Confirms a strong correlation (R = 0.96) between CO₂ concentrations and temperature anomalies.
**Seasonal Patterns:**
Identifies cyclical variations in CO₂ concentrations due to natural processes.
**Lag Analysis:**
Tests short-term and delayed impacts of CO₂ on temperature changes.
**Clustering (K-Means):**
Groups years into 3 climate patterns based on CO₂ levels and temperature anomalies.
**Scenario Simulations:**
Predicts temperature changes under +10%, -10%, +20%, and -20% CO₂ scenarios.
Technologies Used
**Python Libraries:**
**Pandas, NumPy – Data analysis and manipulation.
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization.
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models.
Statsmodels – Statistical analysis.**
**Results & Insights**
Rising CO₂ concentrations are directly linked to temperature anomalies, emphasizing the role of emissions in global warming.
Simulations show higher emissions lead to warming, while reductions can cool temperatures.
**Recommendations**
Emission Reductions: Cut CO₂ emissions by 10–20% through sustainable energy solutions.
Policy Interventions: Enforce stricter regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions.
Research & Monitoring: Invest in climate monitoring and predictive models for better planning.
